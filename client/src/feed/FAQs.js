             The donations go directly to one of our NGO partners. We support 120+ NGOs across 8 cities. Once you raise a request, our NGO mapping algorithm would pick an NGO for your donations depending on various parameters- location, items to be donated, their quantity etc. Then the donations would be picked up by our logistics partner and delivered to the NGO. You would be notified the details of the NGO where your donations went via automated email.
