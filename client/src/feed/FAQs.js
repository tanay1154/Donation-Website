             The donations go directly to one of our NGO partners. We support 120+ NGOs across 8 cities. Once you raise a request, our NGO mapping algorithm would pick an NGO for your donations depending on various parameters- location, items to be donated, their quantity etc. Then the donations would be picked up by our logistics partner and delivered to the NGO. You would be notified the details of the NGO where your donations went via automated email.

        <p>If you've selected "Medium to Heavy Pickup" - Yes, you can add the "2 Carton Combo" to your donation cart. Just make sure to select the add-on "Bring 2 carton boxes" while doing so.</p>

        <p>In any case though, we would recommend you pack your donations in anything you already have at your home. Eg- blue/black disposable bags (bio-degradable type if available). Just make sure to tie them up properly before handing over.</p>

          <p>While raising a pickup request, you will be presented with a list of items accepted by our NGO network. This list usually depends on your location and the pickup option you selected (2-wheeler vs Tempo/Truck). Generally we accept all kinds of reusable* goods – clothes, toys, furniture, kitchen utensils, shoes, handbags, artificial jewellery, school bags and stationery items, prams, treadmills and so on.</p>
